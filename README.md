# CPU Ray Tracer in Modern C++

A ray tracer written fully from scratch using C++, without external graphics engines.
It implements vector math, materials, lighting simulation, and image output to PNG.

# Features
- Custom Vec3 math library
- Ray-object intersection logic (spheres)
- Recursive reflections
- Material system (lambertian, metal, dielectric/glass)
- Random sampling for anti-aliasing
- Image output saved as .png files


Ray → Scene → Objects → Material → Color Output
